# NSLS - CSUN Chapter Site

## Use
The main purpose of this site is to provide answers for member questions that are specifically focused on the CSUN Chapter activities.

The site also serves as a way to keep track of event attendance. Executive members can create and manage events.

Chapter Members can register their attendance either through their mobile phones or Laptops.

This is an attempt at saving paper and reducing the paper trail of sign in sheets left after events.

Basically, I don't want to carry mounts of paper after every meeting. I tend to lose them quickly, and that's bad for members.

## Wanna Help Out?
This project is currently maintained by me - Gabriel Almendarez.

If you would like to participate in this project just talk to me during a campus event.

Or you know, email.

## Project

These two technologies are incorporated using

## Wanna help out and don't know where to start?

### Using Linux?
You need some Node, Git, and Meteor in your life. (If you don't have them already)

Node JS - https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ (get the 4.4.7 version)

Meteor JS - https://www.meteor.com/install (I'm using 1.4)

Git - sudo apt-get install -y git

After installing those stuff, it's time to clone this repo.
Just cd into your desired folder and type 
`git clone https://github.com/gab3alm/csun_nsls.git`

Now, cd into the project and type
`Meteor npm install`

This will install all the project dependencies required.

You are almost there,

After you finish the NPM install, you can just use the following command

`Meteor`

That will initialize the project and install all Meteor (atmosphere js) packages required by the project.

It will take a while (1 min or so), and hopefully you will see the following result

`App running at: http://localhost:3000/`

Congrats, the project is up and running. Now just go to a browser and go to that address.
