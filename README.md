# NSLS - CSUN Chapter Site

## Use
The main purpose of this site is to provide answers for member questions that are specifically focused on the CSUN Chapter activities.
The site also serves as a way to keep track of event attendance.
Executive members can create and manage events.
Chapter Members can register their attendance either through their mobile phones or Laptops.
This is an attempt at saving paper and reducing the paper trail of sign in sheets left after events.
Basically, I don't want to carry mounts of paper after every meeting. I tend to lose them quickly, and that's bad for members.

## Project
CSUN_NSLS is a very small project that uses the following technologies.
Meteor JS - https://www.meteor.com
Angular2 - https://angular.io 
Materialize css - http://materializecss.com (Cool material design CSS framework)
Animate css - https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ (Quick plug and play CSS animations)

These two technologies are incorporated using 
Angular2-Meteor - http://www.angular-meteor.com/
Aside of these technologies, I use just regular HTML and CSS in order to achieve styles and markup layout.
